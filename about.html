            Well i know your question, Why Web Development? <br>
            I have always wondered how these websites functioned and how awsome these websites like 
            netfilx, amazon and other cool sites look and that's when I have started to learn web development
            in my last year of masters and here i am with my own first simple yet cool looking
            website where i have displayed my work and projects.
